Happy Tweaking!!

## CONTRIBUTE

This repository is highly opinionated and new tools' config/script **might not be welcomed** with open arms.

- a good PR with one **bugfix will most likely be merged**.
- a good PR with one new tools' config may get added to a **dedicated new branch** where it might get polished.

PR, Script or Config is a **RED-FLAG** if it is:

- not simple/hackable
- simple but complex usage
- not cli based
- not flexible for small additions
- inter-dependent (not self dependent)
- changes are not atomic :-P

## FINAL WORDS

**Ideally, there should be no contribution** because, opinions are personal.

- *Everyone has their own opinion and same goes for `dotfiles`.*
- Motivate me by putting a star or close this tab with a smiling face. :)
